# To Make a Burger in HTML 

First we need to list the components of the Burger:

- The Top Bun
- Green Lettuce leaf
- Tomato
- Cheese
- Pattie
- Green Lettuce leaf
- The bottom Bun

We have 7 components in this Burger. The first problem in making this Burger in HTML is that HTML doesn’t understand these components; HTML has it’s own components, these are called elements. One such element is “div”. The name “div” stands for division — a small division of the screen.

In HTML, the elements are defined by writing its tag name inside angular brackets. For example: <div></div> will define one “div” element.

Create a file named “index.html”. Feel free to use editor of your choice(I recommend VS Code). Remember to save the file with “.html” extension. Once saved, if you double-click on the file it will open in your web browser.
